This module extends the functionality of website event sales to support
displaying the alternative price in the website event registration page and to
allow your visitors to know the final price in case they will have some special
fiscal tax behavior.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

#. Configure some tickets for your event.
#. The product associated with the tickets should have taxes.
#. Publish the event.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* When the public pricelist is set to display discounts in customer's face and
  the website is set to display prices tax included, the discounted price will
  appear always as tax excluded and produce weird scenarios. This is Odoo's
  bug and not this module's. It has been notified as OPW-2518694. When it's
  fixed upstream, we should check this module still works as expected, although
  it probably should. However, it could depend on the way it's fixed.
