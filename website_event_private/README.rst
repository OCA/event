This module allows you to configure the privacy of website events :

* *Public*: anyone can view the event and register
* *Private displayed*: the event appears in the event list (but not clickable) and one needs access token to see content / register
* *Private hidden*: the event does not appear in the list of events and one needs access token to see content / register

**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:

Configuration
=============


To configure this module, you need to:

#. Go to an event and set the privacy option
#. If you select private displayed or hidden, access token link will appear just after the privacy field

Usage
=====

On private event record, you need to share the access link which is generated
and accessible on backend event form to give access to the event.
