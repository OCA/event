This module allows you to configure the privacy of website events :

* *Public*: anyone can view the event and register
* *Private displayed*: the event appears in the event list (but not clickable) and one needs access token to see content / register
* *Private hidden*: the event does not appear in the list of events and one needs access token to see content / register
