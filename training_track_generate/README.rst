Training track generator
========================

This module was written to combine the functionality of the ``training_track``
and ``event_track_generate`` modules and add the ability to set the training
hour type when batch generating event tracks in training groups.

Usage
=====

See usage instructions for ``event_track_generate``. This module just adds some
special fields required to use it in combination with ``training``.
