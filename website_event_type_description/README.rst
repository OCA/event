This module extends the functionality of events website to support a custom
description for each event type that will be displayed only when events of that
type are filtered, below the common description for the Events page.

Usage
=====

To edit your event type description from the frontend, you need to:

#. Go to `your events page </event>`_.
#. Make sure you *Filter by Category* is enabled in the *Customize* menu.
#. Choose a event type from the filters.
#. Edit the page.
#. You will see a new editable area at the top (just below the one you already
   had) that only will be shown when the page is filtered for this type of
   event.
#. Fill that area with any blocks you want.
#. Save.

To do it from the backend, you need to:

#. Go to *Events > Configuration > Event Categories*.
#. Choose a type.
#. Change its description.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* The best for SEO would be to have a dedicated controller for event types,
  with a friendly slug.
* In such case, the ``event.type`` model should inherit from
  ``website.seo.metadata`` mixin to have access to all SEO tools.
* It's not obvious that there is an editable area on event types website.
