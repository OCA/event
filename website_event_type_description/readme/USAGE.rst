To edit your event type description from the frontend, you need to:

#. Go to `your events page </event>`_.
#. Make sure you *Filter by Category* is enabled in the *Customize* menu.
#. Choose a event type from the filters.
#. Edit the page.
#. You will see a new editable area at the top (just below the one you already
   had) that only will be shown when the page is filtered for this type of
   event.
#. Fill that area with any blocks you want.
#. Save.

To do it from the backend, you need to:

#. Go to *Events > Configuration > Event Categories*.
#. Choose a type.
#. Change its description.
