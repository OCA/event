This module extends the functionality of website_event to support
external events. This allows to list together with internal events,
external events for which registration is managed on another website.

Use Cases / Context
===================

This module is useful when you want to list events which are managed on
an external website. For instance events managed by partners.

It allows to list the external module together with you own events,
without managing registration for the external ones, but redirecting to
external website instead.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

1. Go to an event (on the backend)
2. Just before the date of the event you have a boolean field "External
   Event"
3. Select that field and another one named "External Link" will appear
   that becomes required if "External Event" is selected

When "External Event" is selected, a number of other fields are hidden
on the event form view :

-  "Registration Statistics" and "Attendees" smart button
-  "Extra Register Button"
-  "Limit Attendees" and "Confirmed Attendees"
-  "Autoconfirmation"
-  the full notebook
