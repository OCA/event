Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

Usage
=====

#. Go to any lead in **CRM > Pipeline > Leads**

#. Click on the button "Convert to Opportunity".

#. In the resulting screen, if the conversion action is "Convert to opportunity"
and you have selected a related partner (a new or an existing one), you will
have a section called "Event registration".

"Create opportunity", the partner will be registered automatically in the
event.

In any moment, you can also set a registration for an event by clicking on
button "Generate registration", located in tab "Extra info" in marketing
