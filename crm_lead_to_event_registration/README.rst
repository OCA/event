This module allows to register a lead directly in an event when converting
this lead into a partner, so that you can save several steps.

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

#. Go to **CRM > Configuration > Settings** and check "Leads. Add a qualification step before creating an opportunity" option.

Usage
=====

#. Go to any lead in **CRM > Pipeline > Leads**

#. Click on the button "Convert to Opportunity".

#. In the resulting screen, if the conversion action is "Convert to opportunity"
and you have selected a related partner (a new or an existing one), you will
have a section called "Event registration".

#. In that section, you can select an event, and when you click on
"Create opportunity", the partner will be registered automatically in the
event.

In any moment, you can also set a registration for an event by clicking on
button "Generate registration", located in tab "Extra info" in marketing
section in any lead or opportunity.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* It is necessary to check the compatibility with module *partner_event*
  since when converting the Lead into Event Registration the Contact is not exactly
  the same as the Attendee Partner.
