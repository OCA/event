Training Tracks
===============

This module combines the power of modules ``training`` and
``website_event_track``.

Event tracks can get a training duration type, so it lets the user know if
the training group has fulfilled all the expected hours for it.

Installation
============

This module will be automatically installed when you have installed the modules
``training`` and ``website_event_track``.

Usage
=====

* Enter an event.
* Enter a track in it.
* Use the new field to set a duration type if you want.
