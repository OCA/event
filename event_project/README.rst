This module allows you to assign a project to an event. This project will
inherit its event's name an its due date will be set as the event's begining
date.

Change the event's begining date or its name so the project's due date and name
will be changed. And all the project pending tasks will be retro-planned
according to the new date.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

#. Create a project that will be a template project for events.
#. Go to an event or create a brand new one and assign the previous template
   project.
#. After saving, the event will be related to a copy of the selected template
   project and the new copy project will inherit the name of the event and will
   fit its end date to the begging of the event.
