To use this module, you need to:

#. Create a project that will be a template project for events.
#. Go to an event or create a brand new one and assign the previous template
   project.
#. After saving, the event will be related to a copy of the selected template
   project and the new copy project will inherit the name of the event and will
   fit its end date to the begging of the event.
