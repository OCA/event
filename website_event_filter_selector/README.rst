===============================
Website Event Selection Filters
===============================

This module extends the functionality of the events website page to support
using filters with dropdown selectors and allow you to choose between them and
the core ones (left column).

It also allows you to filter events by city, both in those new filters and
using the old-style left column filters.

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

#. Go to `your website events page </event>`_.
#. Use the *Customize* menu to choose if you want to use the *Selection
   Filters*, and which if so.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* You cannot hide the event date filter without hiding all others.
* You cannot run the tests unless you are in a bare database with demo data.

Bugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues
<https://github.com/OCA/event/issues>`_. In case of trouble, please
