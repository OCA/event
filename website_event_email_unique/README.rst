This module will check whether an attendee already registered with the same e-mail address.
If this is the case, then depending on configuration, the new registration will either:
#. Replace the previous one
#. Be ignored

This module is quite similar in implemented function to event_registration_partner_unique,
except that you do not have to get a partner for each attendee, you only make check on e-mail.
Also there is no dependency to partner_event module since it is not needed here.

**Table of contents**

Configuration
=============

On event record (on the backend), select "Unique registration email" field if you
want to enforce unique emails among registrations.

Once selected, new field "Duplicated email registration behaviour" will appear where
you have to select the expected behavior if an attendee registers with an e-mail
already registered:
#. Delete and recreate registration: will remove previous registration and create a new one
#. Ignore new registration: will silently discard new registration (and keep the previous one)
