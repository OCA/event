On event record (on the backend), select "Unique registration email" field if you
want to enforce unique emails among registrations.

Once selected, new field "Duplicated email registration behaviour" will appear where
you have to select the expected behavior if an attendee registers with an e-mail
already registered:
#. Delete and recreate registration: will remove previous registration and create a new one
#. Ignore new registration: will silently discard new registration (and keep the previous one)
