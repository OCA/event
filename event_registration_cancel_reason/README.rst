Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

#. Go to **Events > Configuration > Registrations cancellation reasons** for setting the possible reasons you want to handle.

You can also set if a reason
is only available for certain types of events or if you leave it empty, for
all.

Usage
=====

#. Go to **Events > Events**
#. Enter into the details of any of the events.
#. Press the button "Attendees", located at the top right hand corner.
#. Press the red button in the right part of any of the registrations.
#. A new screen will appear asking you to enter the reason why the registration is cancelled.

You will get also the same screen:

#. Go to **Events > Reporting > Attendees (view list)**.
#. Enter into the details of any of the attendees.
#. Press the button *Cancel registration*.

On this object, you can group by the cancellation reason in the list, calendar or graph view.
