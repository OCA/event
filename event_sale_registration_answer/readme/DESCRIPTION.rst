Odoo allows to collect answers to questions when buying tickets on the Website.

But in some cases we might collect the answers through another way,
and would like to enter them when completing the sale.

This feature adds a smart button on the Sales Order
to open a list with the answers for each registration.

The answer lines are prepopulated, and the user only needs to enter the answer in each
line.
